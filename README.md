üìß SMS/Email Spam Classifier
Welcome to the SMS/Email Spam Classifier project! This project is designed to help you identify whether a given SMS or email message is spam or not, using a machine learning model that I built and deployed as a Streamlit app.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project was developed with the following steps:

Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned to ensure that only relevant and high-quality information was fed into the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed an in-depth analysis of the data to understand the underlying patterns and distributions, which helped shape the model-building process.
Text Preprocessing: Techniques like tokenization, stemming, and stopwords removal were applied to transform the raw text into a form suitable for model training.
Model Building: I experimented with various models, but the Multinomial Naive Bayes model stood out, achieving 100% precision. However, the data was imbalanced, which required special handling.
Model Improvement: To improve the model's performance, I used TF-IDF with a maximum of 3000 features, which enhanced its ability to classify messages accurately.
Model Training: The model was trained on the preprocessed data, fine-tuned to deliver the best performance.
Streamlit App Development: A user-friendly web application was built using Streamlit to allow users to interact with the model and classify messages in real-time.
Deployment: The Streamlit app was deployed for the community to use, making the power of machine learning accessible to everyone.
üéØ Features
Real-time Classification: Instantly classify messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam".
High Precision: The model was fine-tuned to achieve 100% precision on the test data.
User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit app provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
Community Access: The app is deployed and available for public use.
üîß Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
NLTK: For text preprocessing.
Streamlit: For building and deploying the web application.
üìä Model Performance
The Multinomial Naive Bayes model, improved with TF-IDF vectorization, achieved remarkable performance, particularly in precision, making it highly reliable for spam detection.

üåê Deployment
